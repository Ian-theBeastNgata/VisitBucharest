# VisitBucharest

## Description
A tour guide structure that will display the attractions list, has an audio guide with most used expressions.

## What I learned
* Planed the app design and navigation before coding
* Selected proper data structures to store lists of information
* Built layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigation between activities and fragments using Intents and a ViewPager
* Created custom classes
* Handled images and audio
* Collapsing toolbar and floating buttons
* Used MediaPlayer for the audio guide
